notes: repo is named based on name of parent folder, when making a 'repo' from 
system, need to 'git init' localy and link with new one you make on github.

git init : new repo

git add . : commit all files
git add file.ext : specific file

git commit -m "commit message" : message required

git remote add origin <URL> : link remote repo (done everytime you make one in terminal)

git remote -v : verify the url (prints it)

git branch : print current branch name

git push -u origin <branch name*> : done the first time you push to main
* : master, main, etc. (defaults to master, not main)

git push : done every time after the first time

git status : print list of  staged, modified & not staged, untracked files
git diff : print changes in directory that aren't staged



/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%/%%

Downloadingfrom existing Github repo:
