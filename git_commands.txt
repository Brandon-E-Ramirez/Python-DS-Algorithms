notes: repo is named based on name of parent folder, when making a 'repo' from 
system, need to 'git init' localy and link with new one you make on github.

git init : new repo

git add . : commit all files
git add file.ext : specific file

git commit -m "commit message" : message required

git remote add origin <URL> : link remote repo (done everytime you make one in terminal)

git remote -v : verify the url (prints it)

git push -u origin main : done the first time you push to main
git push : done every time after the first time
